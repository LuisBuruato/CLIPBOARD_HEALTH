### Clipboard Health 

<p>
Here at Clipboard Health, we provide staffing to long-term care facilities. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services publish a quarterly report containing daily staffing data for all registered nursing homes in the U.S. 
</p>
●	Nursing homes are staffed by both employees and contractors. Employees work for the nursing home full time, whereas contractors work for the nursing home on a temporary basis. Most nursing homes are staffed using some combination of full time employees and contractors, but the proportions within each nursing home can vary substantially. All workers from Clipboard Health (and our competitors) are classified as contractors.
●	Clipboard Health is a nationwide staffing platform, operating in all 50 states.
●	There are a variety of other datasets that can be joined to this dataset, all found under the nursing home data section on CMS’ website. 
●	As mentioned previously, the PBJ data is separated by quarter. For this exercise, please focus on the most recent quarter available (2024Q1).

Use the PBJ data and any other CMS data that you see fit to make a few recommendations to the Clipboard Health sales leadership team?
